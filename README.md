# DIY Projects - How you end up spending more money!

Welcome to my repository, a peek into my journey as a broke college student. This is the one line that sums up this repository: **Why buy it when you can DIY it?** 

## The Motivation
I am broke. My questionable financial decisions have finally caught up. So, in my quest to save money, I decided to embark on DIY projects rather than purchasing ready-made applications or hardware. The goal is to DIY things that I would've bought ready-made.

## Reality 
My DIY projects end up costing more than buying a pre-built, perfected product. The projects, while fun and educational, cost me more stress, time, and money than it would have had I just bought it.

2 hours of Googling how to create a box in an Android application is not fun.

## Projects List 
These are the lists of my DIY projects. To be constantly updated.

- **[PiHub](#https://github.com/dajeprk/piHub/tree/main)**: Linux Application (So far) to manage the 10+ Raspberry Pis on my network.
- **TBC**

## Reflections So Far
My man has a tendency to jump in to every idea that pops up in his head. Maybe it would've paid to do some research beforehand.
